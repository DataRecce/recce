# Linear Deep Dive

Analyze a Linear issue or project end-to-end — understand it, explore the codebase, propose an approach, and orchestrate the right workflow to solve it.

## Invocation

```
/linear-deep-dive <issue ID, identifier, URL, or project name/URL>
```

Examples:
- `/linear-deep-dive DRC-2893`
- `/linear-deep-dive https://linear.app/recce/issue/DRC-2893/...`
- `/linear-deep-dive "Mypy Strict Typing"`
- `/linear-deep-dive https://linear.app/recce/project/mypy-strict-typing-abc123`

## Process

### 1. Parse Input and Detect Entry Type

Determine whether the input is an **issue** or a **project**:

| Input Pattern | Entry Type |
|---|---|
| `DRC-2893` (team prefix + number) | Issue |
| URL containing `/issue/` | Issue |
| URL containing `/project/` | Project |
| Quoted string or slug with no team prefix | Project (search by name) |

**Issue identifiers:** `DRC-2893`, `https://linear.app/recce/issue/DRC-2893/...`
**Project identifiers:** `"Mypy Strict Typing"`, `https://linear.app/recce/project/mypy-strict-typing-abc123`

For project URLs, extract the slug from the path. For plain strings without a team prefix pattern (`XXX-NNN`), treat as a project name search.

Once the entry type is determined, follow the appropriate flow:
- **Issue** → proceed to [Issue Flow](#issue-flow)
- **Project** → proceed to [Project Flow](#project-flow)

## Issue Flow

### 2. Fetch Issue

Use the Linear MCP server to retrieve the full issue with relations:

```
Tool: mcp__claude_ai_Linear_2__get_issue
  id: <identifier>
  includeRelations: true
```

Extract and note:
- **Title and description** — the core problem statement
- **Priority** — how urgent this is
- **Status** — current workflow state
- **Labels** — issue classification (Bug, Feature, Improvement, etc.)
- **Assignee** — who owns it
- **Relations** — blocking/blocked-by/related issues
- **Key files** — any file paths mentioned in the description
- **Git branch** — the `gitBranchName` field (use this for work)

Also fetch comments for additional context:

```
Tool: mcp__claude_ai_Linear_2__list_comments
  issueId: <issue UUID>
```

### 3. Classify the Issue

Determine the issue type from title, description, and labels. This drives which skills to invoke later.

| Classification | Signals | Primary Workflow |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Feature** | Label: Feature, "add", "new", "implement", "support" | brainstorming → writing-plans → executing-plans |
| **Bug** | Label: Bug, "fix", "broken", "regression", "error", stack traces | systematic-debugging → TDD |
| **Refactor** | Label: Improvement, "refactor", "eliminate", "simplify", "clean up" | writing-plans → TDD → executing-plans |
| **Investigation** | "investigate", "understand", "why does", "how does", question marks | codebase exploration → summary document |

If the classification is ambiguous, ask the user:

> This issue could be approached as a **refactor** or a **feature**. The description mentions eliminating a pattern (refactor) but also introduces new cache-patching behavior (feature). How would you like to approach it?

### 4. Explore Codebase

This is the core research phase. Use the Agent tool with `subagent_type: Explore` for broad discovery, and direct Read/Grep/Glob for targeted lookups.

**Step 4a — Read files mentioned in the issue:**

If the issue description references specific files (common in well-written issues), read them first. These are the author's pointers to the relevant code.

**Step 4b — Discover related code:**

Based on what you learn from the referenced files, explore outward:
- Grep for key function/variable names mentioned in the issue
- Find related test files for the affected code
- Check imports and callers of the affected modules
- Look for similar patterns elsewhere that might be affected

**Step 4c — Check related Linear issues:**

If the issue has relations (blocking, blocked-by, related), fetch those issues briefly to understand the broader context. Don't deep-dive them — just note how they connect.

**Step 4d — Check the git branch:**

If the issue has a `gitBranchName`, check its state:

```bash
git fetch origin
git branch -a | grep "<branch-name>"
git log origin/main..origin/<branch-name> --oneline  # If branch exists: what's already done?
```

If the branch already has commits, read through them to understand work-in-progress.

### 5. Build Context

Synthesize everything into a structured analysis. Write this to a temp working document:

```bash
# Save analysis to gitignored docs directory
mkdir -p docs/plans
```

**Analysis document structure:**

```markdown
# Deep Dive: <ISSUE-ID> — <Title>

## Issue Summary
<1-3 sentence distillation of the problem/request>

## Classification
**Type:** <feature | bug | refactor | investigation>
**Priority:** <from Linear>
**Labels:** <from Linear>

## Current State
<What the code does today — based on codebase exploration>

## Key Files
| File | Role | Lines of Interest |
|------|------|-------------------|
| `path/to/file.ts` | Description | L42-87: relevant function |

## Related Issues
| Issue | Title | Relationship |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| DRC-XXXX | Title | blocks / related to |

## Risks and Open Questions
- <Risk or uncertainty that needs clarification>
- <Anything the issue description assumes but code doesn't confirm>

## Proposed Approach
<See Step 6>
```

### 6. Propose Approach

Based on the classification and codebase exploration, propose a concrete approach. Present this to the user **before** executing.

**The proposal must include:**

1. **Approach summary** — 2-3 sentences on what you'll do
2. **Classification and workflow** — which skills will be invoked and why
3. **Task breakdown** — high-level steps (not full plan yet — that's for writing-plans)
4. **Scope boundaries** — what's in scope and explicitly what's NOT
5. **Risks** — anything that might complicate the work
6. **Estimated complexity** — small (1-2 files), medium (3-5 files), large (6+ files)

**Format the proposal clearly:**

```markdown
## Proposed Approach for <ISSUE-ID>

**Classification:** Refactor
**Workflow:** writing-plans → TDD → executing-plans
**Complexity:** Medium (4 files)

### What I'll Do
<2-3 sentence summary>

### Steps
1. <High-level step>
2. <High-level step>
3. ...

### Scope
**In scope:** <what's included>
**Out of scope:** <what's explicitly excluded>

### Risks
- <Risk and mitigation>

### Ready to proceed?
I'll start by invoking **writing-plans** to create a detailed implementation plan.
```

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

### 7. Orchestrate — Invoke the Right Skills

Based on classification and user confirmation, invoke the appropriate skill chain. The skill invocations below are the **default workflows** — adjust based on the specific issue.

**Before invoking any skill, update the issue status to "In Progress":**

```
Tool: mcp__claude_ai_Linear_2__save_issue
  id: <issue identifier>
  state: "In Progress"
```

#### Feature Workflow

```
1. Invoke: superpowers:brainstorming
   - Feed it the issue summary and proposed approach
   - Let it explore alternatives and refine the design

2. Invoke: superpowers:writing-plans
   - Create detailed implementation plan from the brainstorming output
   - Plan includes exact file paths, code changes, and verification steps

3. Invoke: superpowers:executing-plans (or superpowers:subagent-driven-development)
   - Execute the plan with review checkpoints
```

#### Bug Workflow

```
1. Invoke: superpowers:systematic-debugging
   - Follow the four phases: investigate → analyze → hypothesize → implement
   - Use the issue description as the starting point for reproduction

2. Invoke: superpowers:test-driven-development
   - Write a failing test that reproduces the bug FIRST
   - Then implement the fix
   - Verify the test passes
```

#### Refactor Workflow

```
1. Invoke: superpowers:writing-plans
   - Create a detailed refactoring plan
   - Emphasize: preserve existing behavior, add tests for current behavior first

2. Invoke: superpowers:test-driven-development
   - For each refactoring step: verify existing tests pass, then refactor

3. Invoke: superpowers:executing-plans (or superpowers:subagent-driven-development)
   - Execute with frequent verification checkpoints
```

#### Investigation Workflow

```
1. Use Agent tool (subagent_type: Explore) for deep codebase analysis
2. Summarize findings in docs/plans/<date>-<issue-id>-findings.md
3. Post findings back to the Linear issue as a comment (with user permission)
```

---

## Branch Management

Before starting any implementation work:

```bash
# Check if the issue's branch already exists
BRANCH="<gitBranchName from Linear>"
git fetch origin

# If branch exists remotely, create local tracking branch
git checkout -t "origin/$BRANCH"

# If branch doesn't exist remotely, create from main
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b "$BRANCH"
```

Always work on the issue's designated branch. Never implement directly on `main`.

---

## Handling Edge Cases

### Issue has blockers
If the issue is blocked by other issues (`blockedBy` relations), inform the user:

> This issue is blocked by **DRC-XXXX**: "<title>". Would you like to:
> 1. Work on the blocker first
> 2. Proceed anyway (the blocker may not actually prevent progress)
> 3. Skip this issue for now

### Issue is vague or underspecified
If the issue lacks sufficient detail to propose an approach:

> The issue description doesn't specify [missing detail]. Before I can propose an approach, I need to understand:
> - [Specific question]
> - [Specific question]

### Issue spans frontend and backend
For full-stack issues, note both sides in the analysis and propose whether to tackle them together or separately. Default to **backend first** (APIs and data models), then frontend.

### Issue already has work-in-progress
If the git branch has existing commits, analyze them:
- What's already been done?
- Does it align with the issue description?
- Should we build on it or take a different approach?

Present findings to the user before proposing next steps.

---

## Project Flow

Use this flow when the input is a Linear **project** (not a single issue). A project is a collection of issues organized by milestones with a shared goal, description, and timeline.

> **Spacedock alternative.** For multi-issue projects you intend to work across multiple sessions, the [`linear-delivery`](../../../docs/workflows/linear-delivery/README.md) workflow can seed N entities at commission time from a Linear project URL — milestone/priority become entity scores, and dispatch ordering replaces the in-conversation 4-option execution prompt at Step 11. See **Spacedock integration** at the bottom of this file.

### 8. Fetch Project

Retrieve the project with its full context:

```
Tool: mcp__claude_ai_Linear_2__get_project
  query: <project name, slug, or ID>
  includeMilestones: true
  includeMembers: true
  includeResources: true
```

Extract and note:
- **Name and description** — the project's purpose and goals
- **`id`** — the project UUID (needed for subsequent queries)
- **`name`** — the project display name (needed for subsequent queries)
- **Status** — planned, started, paused, completed
- **Start/target dates** — timeline constraints
- **Lead** — who owns the project
- **Members** — who's involved
- **Milestones** — the project's phases/workstreams
- **Resources** — linked documents, specs, designs
- **Progress** — completion percentage

Also fetch recent status updates for additional context:

```
Tool: mcp__claude_ai_Linear_2__get_status_updates
  type: "project"
  project: <project name or ID>
  limit: 5
```

### 9. Fetch Milestones and Issues

**IMPORTANT:** The `list_issues` and `list_milestones` tools do NOT reliably resolve URL slugs (e.g., `mypy-cleanup-ef517c78ef98`). You MUST use the **project name** or **project UUID** from the Step 8 `get_project` response. Do NOT run this step in parallel with Step 8 — wait for `get_project` to return first, then use the resolved `name` or `id`.

Retrieve the project's milestones to understand the phased structure:

```
Tool: mcp__claude_ai_Linear_2__list_milestones
  project: <project name from get_project>   # e.g., "MyPy Cleanup", NOT the URL slug
```

Then fetch **all issues** in the project (can run in parallel with milestones):

```
Tool: mcp__claude_ai_Linear_2__list_issues
  project: <project name from get_project>   # e.g., "MyPy Cleanup", NOT the URL slug
  limit: 250
```

For each issue, note:
- **Identifier and title**
- **Status** — backlog, todo, in progress, done, cancelled
- **Priority** — urgent (1) through low (4)
- **Labels** — bug, feature, etc.
- **Assignee** — who's working on it
- **Relations** — blocking/blocked-by dependencies between issues

### 10. Build Project Map

Synthesize the project into a structured overview. Group issues by milestone and status.

**Project map structure:**

```markdown
# Project Deep Dive: <Project Name>

## Project Summary
<2-3 sentence distillation of the project's purpose from its description>

## Status
**State:** <planned | started | paused | completed>
**Progress:** <X% complete>
**Timeline:** <start date> → <target date>
**Lead:** <name>

## Recent Updates
- <Date>: <summary of latest status update>

## Milestone Breakdown

### Milestone 1: <Name> (<status>)
**Description:** <milestone description>

| Issue | Title | Status | Priority | Assignee | Blocked By |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|----------|------------|
| DRC-XXX | ... | Todo | High | ... | DRC-YYY |

### Milestone 2: <Name> (<status>)
...

## Issues Without Milestone
| Issue | Title | Status | Priority | Assignee |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|----------|
| DRC-XXX | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Dependency Graph
<List of blocking relationships across issues>

## Risks and Gaps
- <Issues with no assignee>
- <Blocked issues with no path to unblocking>
- <Milestones with no issues>
- <Overdue milestones>
```

Save this document to `docs/plans/<date>-project-<slug>-deep-dive.md`.

### 11. Prioritize and Propose Execution Plan

Determine the order to address issues, respecting:

1. **Milestone ordering** — earlier milestones first; don't skip ahead unless a milestone is fully blocked
2. **Dependencies** — never start an issue that is blocked by incomplete work
3. **Priority** — within a milestone, address urgent/high priority issues first
4. **Status** — skip issues that are done or cancelled; prioritize "in progress" issues (someone already started), then "todo", then "backlog"
5. **Issue type** — bugs before features within the same priority tier (bugs unblock existing functionality)

**Build an execution queue:**

```markdown
## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: <Milestone Name>

**Ready now** (no blockers, not done):
1. DRC-XXX — <title> [Priority: High, Type: Bug]
2. DRC-YYY — <title> [Priority: High, Type: Feature]

**Blocked** (waiting on other issues):
3. DRC-ZZZ — <title> [Blocked by: DRC-XXX]

### Phase 2: <Milestone Name>
...

### Recommended Starting Point
Start with **DRC-XXX** because: <reasoning — highest priority, unblocks others, etc.>
```

**Present this to the user and ask:**

> Here's the project overview and my recommended execution order. Would you like to:
> 1. **Start from the top** — work through issues in the order I've proposed
> 2. **Pick a specific issue** — jump to a particular issue you want to tackle
> 3. **Focus on a milestone** — work through a specific milestone only
> 4. **Adjust the plan** — reorder or exclude certain issues

### 12. Execute Systematically

Once the user confirms the approach, work through issues one at a time. For each issue:

1. **Deep-dive the individual issue** — follow the Issue Flow (Steps 2-7) for the selected issue, using its full context from the project map
2. **Carry forward project context** — when exploring the codebase, leverage knowledge from previous issues in the same project (shared files, patterns, architectural decisions)
3. **Respect milestone boundaries** — when finishing the last issue in a milestone, pause and report milestone completion before moving to the next
4. **Update the execution plan** — after completing each issue, reassess:
   - Are previously blocked issues now unblocked?
   - Did this work reveal new issues that should be added to the project?
   - Has the priority ordering changed?

**Between issues, report progress:**

```markdown
## Progress Update

**Completed:** DRC-XXX — <title>
**Milestone:** <Milestone Name> — X/Y issues done
**Unblocked:** DRC-ZZZ (was waiting on DRC-XXX)
**Next up:** DRC-YYY — <title>

Continue with DRC-YYY?
```

**Wait for user confirmation before starting each new issue.** The user may want to pause, switch to a different issue, or stop for the session.

### 13. Handle Project Edge Cases

#### Project has no milestones
Treat all issues as a flat list. Prioritize by: priority > status > dependencies > creation date.

#### Project has many issues (50+)
Focus the initial proposal on the top 10-15 actionable issues. Mention the total count and offer to show more:

> This project has 73 issues. I'm showing the 12 highest-priority actionable issues. Want me to expand the view?

#### Multiple milestones are in progress simultaneously
Present them as parallel workstreams and ask the user which to focus on. Don't interleave issues from different milestones unless the user requests it.

#### Issue belongs to multiple projects
Prioritize the project that was the entry point for the deep dive. Note the cross-project membership in the analysis.

#### Mid-session context: previously completed issues
If resuming work on a project across sessions, re-fetch the project state to pick up any issues that were completed outside this session (by other team members or in other sessions).

---

## Linear Issue Status Management

**You MUST update Linear issue status at each lifecycle transition.** This is not optional — it keeps the team's board accurate and prevents false progress signals.

### Status Transition Table

| Event | Action | Tool Call |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Starting work on an issue (after user confirms approach in Step 6) | Set **In Progress** | `mcp__claude_ai_Linear_2__save_issue` with `state: "In Progress"` |
| Creating a PR for the issue | Set **In Review** | `mcp__claude_ai_Linear_2__save_issue` with `state: "In Review"` |
| PR merged to `main` | Set **Done** | `mcp__claude_ai_Linear_2__save_issue` with `state: "Done"` |
| PR closed without merge | Set **In Progress** | `mcp__claude_ai_Linear_2__save_issue` with `state: "In Progress"` |

### When to Transition

**In Progress — triggered by Step 7 (Orchestrate):**
Immediately after the user confirms the approach and before invoking any implementation skill, update the issue:

```
Tool: mcp__claude_ai_Linear_2__save_issue
  id: <issue identifier, e.g., "DRC-2893">
  state: "In Progress"
```

**In Review — triggered by PR creation:**
When using the `create-pr` skill or running `gh pr create`, update the issue immediately after the PR is successfully created:

```
Tool: mcp__claude_ai_Linear_2__save_issue
  id: <issue identifier>
  state: "In Review"
```

If the PR title or body references the issue (e.g., `Closes DRC-2893`), still explicitly update the status — do not rely on Linear's GitHub integration for timely status changes.

**Done — triggered only by confirmed merge:**
Only set Done after verifying the PR has been merged:

```bash
gh pr view <PR-number> --json state --jq '.state'
# Must return "MERGED"
```

```
Tool: mcp__claude_ai_Linear_2__save_issue
  id: <issue identifier>
  state: "Done"
```

**NEVER set Done based on PR creation, CI passing, or approval.** The merge is the gate. See `references/linear-issue-lifecycle.md`.

### Project Flow Status Management

When working through a project (Steps 8-12), apply the same status transitions to each issue as you work through the execution queue. Additionally:

- When picking an issue from the execution queue to start work, set it to **In Progress**
- When all issues in a milestone are Done, note this in the progress update
- When re-fetching project state (mid-session context recovery), respect existing statuses — don't re-transition issues that are already in the correct state

---

## Iron Rules

**For all entry types:**
- **Always fetch first.** Never propose an approach based on the title alone — fetch the full issue or project.
- **Always explore the codebase.** Never propose changes to code you haven't read.
- **Always confirm with the user.** Never start implementation without presenting the approach and getting approval.
- **Respect the skill chain.** Use brainstorming for features, systematic-debugging for bugs. Don't skip steps.
- **Stay in scope.** The issue or project defines the boundaries. Don't expand scope without discussing with the user.
- **Save your analysis.** Write the deep-dive document to `docs/plans/` so it persists across sessions.

**For Linear issue status management:**
- **ALWAYS update issue status at lifecycle transitions.** Set "In Progress" when work begins, "In Review" when a PR is created. This is mandatory, not optional.
- **NEVER mark issues as "Done" until the PR has been merged to `main`.** When a PR is opened, move issues to "In Review". Only transition to "Done" after confirming the merge. See `references/linear-issue-lifecycle.md`.
- **Status flow:** Triage → In Progress (work starts) → In Review (PR opened) → Done (PR merged).

**For issues:**
- **Use the issue's git branch.** Always work on `gitBranchName` from Linear, never on `main`.

**For projects:**
- **Create a branch for the project.** If the project doesn't have a branch, create one named `project/<slug>` and work there. Never work on `main`.
- **Respect milestone order.** Don't jump ahead to later milestones while earlier ones have actionable work.
- **Respect dependencies.** Never start a blocked issue. Always check if completing an issue unblocks others.
- **Report progress between issues.** The user should always know where they are in the execution plan.
- **Pause at milestone boundaries.** Completing a milestone is a natural checkpoint — report it and confirm the next phase.
- **Carry context forward.** Reuse codebase knowledge from earlier issues — don't re-explore the same files from scratch.

## Spacedock integration

A Spacedock workflow generalizes this skill for persistent multi-session use: [`docs/workflows/linear-delivery/`](../../../docs/workflows/linear-delivery/README.md). The workflow's stages (`triage → analysis → approval → implementation → review → done`) mirror this skill's per-issue lifecycle, with the Linear MCP `save_issue` calls centralized in a `linear-status-sync` mod that enforces the iron rule from `references/linear-issue-lifecycle.md` at one chokepoint.

**Decision rule.** Prefer the workflow for persistent multi-session state; use this skill for one-shot conversation flow.

- Use the **workflow** when: the issue or project will span multiple Claude Code sessions, you want on-disk record of *what stage we're at* per issue, you are processing many issues in priority order and want first-officer dispatch to handle the queue, or you want the captain-gated approval and PR merge gate enforced by the workflow scaffolding.
- Use this **skill** directly when: you want a single in-conversation flow start-to-finish, the issue is small enough to fit in one session, or you don't want the overhead of a per-entity markdown file.

The workflow seeds from this skill — its analysis stage carries forward the classification rubric, key-files table, and skill-chain mapping documented above (lines 78, 145, 219–266). The skill chain itself (`brainstorming` / `writing-plans` / `executing-plans` / `systematic-debugging` / `TDD`) is invoked at the workflow's `implementation` stage exactly as it is here.
